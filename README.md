The application enables managing company resources, such as employees, warehouses, and items in warehouses.
It provides the possibility of managing employees by adding, removing, and previewing data, such as salaries.
We also have the option of managing warehouses, which can also be added or removed. We can view detailed data on a given warehouse, such as its address, items, and their quantities inside it.
The item panel in a particular warehouse also allows transporting them between warehouses and selling.
All owned items and their quantities across all warehouses can be viewed using the panel. For each item, we can see in which warehouses they are located.

# General Purpose
